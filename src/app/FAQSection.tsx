            This app integrates with the Google Meet API to create and end
            meetings. When you start a meeting, this app sends a request to the
            Google Meet API to create a new meeting. At the scheduled end time,
            another request is sent to the Google Meet API to end the meeting.
            The meeting can only be ended if it is active at that moment.

            Why can it not end meetings I created myself?

          <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600">
            The app can only end meetings that it created itself due to
            limitations in the Google Meet API. These ensures that apps in
            general cannot interfere with meetings created by other means.
